Fuzzy Sets Type
=========================

This section provides comprehensive documentation for the specialized fuzzy set types
implemented in AxisFuzzy, focusing on advanced mathematical frameworks that extend
traditional fuzzy logic capabilities. These sophisticated fuzzy set types enable
researchers and practitioners to model complex uncertainty scenarios with enhanced
precision and flexibility.

The documentation covers two primary categories of advanced fuzzy sets: q-Rung
Orthopair Fuzzy Numbers (qROFN) and q-Rung Orthopair Hesitant Fuzzy Numbers (qROHFN).
These mathematical structures represent significant advances in fuzzy set theory,
providing powerful tools for handling uncertainty, imprecision, and hesitation in
decision-making processes.

q-Rung Orthopair Fuzzy Numbers extend the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy sets by
introducing a parameter q that allows for more flexible membership and non-membership
degree relationships. This generalization enables modeling of scenarios where the
sum of membership and non-membership degrees can exceed unity, providing greater
expressiveness in uncertainty representation.

q-Rung Orthopair Hesitant Fuzzy Numbers further enhance this framework by incorporating
hesitation elements, allowing decision-makers to express multiple possible membership
and non-membership values simultaneously. This capability is particularly valuable
in group decision-making scenarios where consensus may be difficult to achieve.

Each fuzzy type includes detailed mathematical definitions, implementation guidelines,
practical examples, and integration methods with AxisFuzzy's core functionality.
