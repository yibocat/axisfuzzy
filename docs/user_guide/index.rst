User Guide
=========================

Welcome to the comprehensive AxisFuzzy User Guide, your essential resource for mastering
the powerful capabilities of this advanced fuzzy logic framework. This documentation
provides detailed guidance on all core components and functionalities that enable you
to build sophisticated fuzzy systems with confidence and precision.

The user guide covers eight fundamental areas of AxisFuzzy usage, starting with core
data structures that form the foundation of all fuzzy operations. You'll explore
comprehensive fuzzy operations for manipulating and combining fuzzy sets, along with
membership functions that define the mathematical relationships within your fuzzy logic
systems. The guide also covers fuzzification processes for converting crisp values
into fuzzy representations.

Additionally, you'll discover random number generation capabilities for stochastic
fuzzy applications, extension mixins for enhancing functionality, configuration
management for customizing system behavior, and fuzzy type definitions for creating
specialized fuzzy set implementations. Each section provides practical examples,
detailed explanations, and best practices to help you leverage AxisFuzzy's full
potential in your projects.

Whether you're implementing decision support systems, control algorithms, or data
analysis pipelines, this user guide serves as your roadmap to effective fuzzy
logic programming with AxisFuzzy.
