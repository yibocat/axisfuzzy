Future Extensions
*******************

AxisFuzzy is designed to be an extensible framework. This section provides a glimpse into the planned future extensions and how you can contribute to the development of the library.

Analysis Module
===============

The `analysis` module is currently under development and aims to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for fuzzy data analysis. Key features will include:

- **Fuzzy Clustering**: Algorithms for grouping data into fuzzy clusters.
- **Fuzzy Time Series Analysis**: Models for forecasting based on fuzzy time series data.
- **Integration with Pandas**: A seamless integration with the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.

Advanced Fuzzy Systems
======================

We plan to introduce support for more advanced fuzzy systems, such as:

- **Type-2 Fuzzy Logic**: Systems that can handle a higher degree of uncertainty.
- **Neuro-Fuzzy Systems**: Hybrid systems that combine the learning capabilities of neural networks with the reasoning capabilities of fuzzy logic.

How to Contribute
=================

AxisFuzzy is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. If you are interested in contributing to the development of these future extensions, please refer to our contribution guidelines and get in touch with the development team.

Your contributions can help shape the future of AxisFuzzy and make it an even more powerful tool for the fuzzy logic community.
