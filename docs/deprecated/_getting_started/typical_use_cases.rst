Typical Use Cases
*******************

AxisFuzzy can be applied to a wide range of problems. This section highlights some typical use cases where fuzzy logic and AxisFuzzy can be particularly effective.

Decision Making Systems
=======================

Fuzzy logic is well-suited for modeling complex decision-making processes that involve uncertainty and imprecise information. For example, in a medical diagnosis system, fuzzy logic can be used to represent the ambiguity of symptoms and test results.

.. code-block:: python

    from axisfuzzy.core import fuzznum

    # Fuzzy representation of a patient's temperature
    temperature = fuzznum.Triangular(37.5, 38.5, 39.5)  # Represents a fever

    # Fuzzy representation of symptom severity
    severity = fuzznum.Trapezoidal(0.5, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0)  # High severity

    # Decision logic can be implemented using fuzzy rules

Control Systems
===============

Fuzzy control systems are used in a variety of applications, from consumer electronics to industrial automation. A classic example is a fuzzy thermostat that controls room temperature more smoothly than a traditional on/off controller.

.. math::

   IF \text{ (temperature is cold) } THEN \text{ (heater is high) }

This kind of rule-based reasoning can be implemented using AxisFuzzy to create intelligent control systems.

Data Analysis and Classification
================================

Fuzzy logic can be used to classify data that does not have clear boundaries. For instance, in customer segmentation, customers can be classified into fuzzy categories like "high-value" or "low-engagement" based on their behavior.

AxisFuzzy's `analysis` module provides tools for integrating fuzzy logic with data analysis libraries like Pandas, enabling you to perform fuzzy clustering and classification.

Risk Assessment
===============

In finance and insurance, fuzzy logic can be used to model and assess risks that are difficult to quantify with crisp numbers. For example, the risk of a project failing can be represented as a fuzzy number that captures the uncertainty involved.

.. code-block:: python

    from axisfuzzy.core import fuzznum

    # Fuzzy representation of project risk
    project_risk = fuzznum.Gaussian(0.6, 0.1)  # Centered around a 60% risk level

These are just a few examples of how AxisFuzzy can be used. The library's flexibility and extensibility make it a powerful tool for a wide variety of applications involving fuzzy logic.
