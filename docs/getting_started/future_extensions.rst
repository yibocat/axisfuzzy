Future Extensions
=================

`AxisFuzzy` aims to become a high-performance, highly scalable fuzzy system framework, providing a professional Python solution for fuzzy logic computations. This section will briefly introduce the planned future expansion features and how you can contribute to the development of this library.

Analysis Module
----------------

The `analysis` module is currently under development and aims to provide a comprehensive suite of tools for fuzzy data analysis. Key features will include:

- Fuzzy data analysis computing engine based on fuzzy computation graphs

- High-performance processing of large-scale fuzzy data

- Seamless integration with Pandas

- Integration with Polars

- Support for parallel and distributed computing

Advanced Fuzzy Systems
----------------------

We plan to introduce support for more advanced fuzzy systems, providing a rich toolkit for complex problems. Key planned features include:

- **Fuzzy Relation/Rule Mining**
  Automatically discover interesting fuzzy association rules and relationships from data. For example, in market basket analysis, fuzzy rules such as "if customers purchase 'a considerable number of' item A, they 'are highly likely to' purchase item B" can be mined, providing more flexible insights for business decisions.

- **Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS)**
  Build a complete, end-to-end fuzzy inference system, including the two main types: Mamdani and Sugeno. This will allow users to define a set of fuzzy rules and infer final conclusions based on input variables (whether crisp or fuzzy). This will be the core of implementing fuzzy control and decision support systems.

- **Fuzzy Control Systems (FCS)**
  Provides specialized tools for designing and simulating fuzzy controllers. Users will be able to easily define control variables, fuzzy rules, and defuzzification strategies to build intelligent controllers for industrial automation, robotics, and consumer electronics, achieving smoother and more stable system responses.

- **Fuzzy Measures and Fuzzy Integrals**
  Introduce tools such as Sugeno measures and Choquet integrals for handling aggregate problems where interactions between features exist. This is particularly useful in multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), where it can model complex decision preferences more accurately than traditional weighted averaging.

- **Fuzzy Clustering**
  Implement advanced clustering algorithms such as Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and its variants. Unlike hard clustering, fuzzy clustering allows a data point to belong to multiple clusters simultaneously by assigning membership degrees, thereby better capturing the underlying structure and overlapping regions of the data. It is widely used in image segmentation, pattern recognition, and bioinformatics.

- **Fuzzy Neural Networks (FNN)**
  Combine the reasoning capabilities of fuzzy logic with the learning abilities of neural networks. `AxisFuzzy` will provide building blocks for creating hybrid models that can automatically learn and optimize membership functions and fuzzy rules from data, enabling adaptive fuzzy systems.

- **Neuro-Fuzzy Systems**
  This is a further development of fuzzy neural networks, aiming to create neural networks that are functionally equivalent to fuzzy inference systems. We will provide tools to build and train such systems (e.g., ANFIS), enabling them to not only learn from data but also have their internal structures (weights and nodes) interpreted as human-readable fuzzy rules, perfectly aligning with the need for explainable AI (XAI).

- **Fuzzy Reinforcement Learning (FRL)**
  Integrate fuzzy logic into reinforcement learning frameworks to handle continuous state and action spaces. By using a set of fuzzy rules to partition the state space and approximate the policy, FRL can significantly improve learning efficiency and generalization capabilities, especially in complex control tasks such as robot navigation, game AI, and resource management.

- **Type-2 Fuzzy Logic**
  Extend the core of the library to support type-2 fuzzy logic. Type-2 fuzzy sets allow for handling higher levels of uncertainty (i.e., the membership function itself is fuzzy), making the models more robust against noisy or incomplete data. This is particularly important in fields such as financial forecasting, medical diagnosis, and control systems.
